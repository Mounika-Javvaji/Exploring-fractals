# Exploring Fractals

## 1) THE PYTHAGORAS TREE FRACTAL

**Description:**
The Pythagoras Tree is a fractal constructed from squares. At each iteration, two smaller squares are appended to each square's right edge, forming a right triangle. This process is then repeated recursively.

**Usage:**
To explore the Pythagoras Tree Fractal, you can start by drawing a single square. Then, for each square, append two smaller squares on its right edge, forming a right triangle. Repeat this process recursively for each new square added.

**Features:**
- Visualize the fractal at different levels of recursion.
- Experiment with different angles and scaling factors to create variations.

## 2) L SYSTEMS

**Description:**
Lindenmayer Systems (L-Systems) are a method of modeling the growth of complex structures through simple rules. Using an alphabet of symbols and a set of production rules, L-Systems iteratively generate strings of symbols, which can then be interpreted to create intricate patterns and fractals.

**Usage:**
Begin with an initial string of symbols, then apply production rules iteratively to replace each symbol with a defined sequence of symbols. By interpreting these strings, one can visualize a wide array of fractal shapes, from branching trees to intricate geometric patterns.

**Features:**
-Explore fractal patterns by adjusting production rules and initial configurations.
-Visualize fractals at varying levels of detail by controlling the number of iterations.
-Experiment with different interpretations and rendering methods for diverse visual outputs.

## 3) IFS (Iterated Function System)

**Description:**
IFS is a method for constructing fractals by repeatedly applying a set of affine transformations to an initial geometric shape.

**Usage:**
Define a set of affine transformations, each represented by linear functions and translations. Apply these transformations iteratively to generate complex fractal patterns.

**Features:**
- Define custom affine transformations.
- Experiment with different sets of transformations to create various fractal designs.
- Control parameters such as scaling, rotation, and translation for each transformation.

## 4) Complex Numbers:

**Description:**
Complex numbers are numbers that can be expressed in the form a + bi, where 'a' and 'b' are real numbers and 'i' is the imaginary unit, satisfying the equation i^2 = -1.

**Usage:**
Explore the properties and operations of complex numbers, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.

**Features:**
- Perform arithmetic operations with complex numbers.
- Visualize complex numbers on the complex plane.
- Understand the geometric interpretation of complex number operations.

## 5) WIREFRAME

**Description:**
Wireframe rendering is a technique used in computer graphics to represent three-dimensional objects as a collection of lines and curves.

**Usage:**
Generate wireframe representations of geometric shapes, including fractals, to visualize their structure and form.

**Features:**
- Render wireframe models of fractals and other geometric objects.
- Control parameters such as line thickness, color, and perspective.
- Explore different viewpoints to observe the shape from various angles.
